[Independence Inn]

MICHEL: Independence Inn, Michel speaking.

[Inn kitchen]

SOOKIE: I fixed the peach sauce.

LORELAI: I want to take a bath in that sauce.

SOOKIE: I will make more.

[Inn front desk]

LORELAI: Have Michel look at your french paper before you go.

MICHEL: Excuse me?

RORY: That’d be great.

MICHEL: No.

[Inn kitchen

RORY: What’s going on?

LORELAI: Open it.

RORY: I’m gonna be in a Brittney Spears video?

SOOKIE: You’re going to Chilton! Oh, sorry.

[Stars Hollow High]

LANE: So I told my mom you’re changing school.

RORY: Was she thrilled?

LANE: The party’s on Friday.

[Lorelai on the phone]

LORELAI: I got the invoice for your enrollment fee.

[Inn kitchen]

LORELAI: You did it babe, you got in.

[Lorelai on the phone]

LORELAI: Wow that’s a lot of zeros behind that five.

[Grandma’s house]

LORELAI: Hi mom.

GRANDMA: Lorelai, my goodness, this is a surprised.

GRANDPA: So you need money.

LORELAI: It’s not for me, it’s for Rory.

GRANDMA: Since we are now financially involved in your life, I want to be actively involved in your life.

[Chilton]

CHARLESTON: Ms. Gilmore, I’m headmaster Charleston.

LORELAI: Mom, what are you doing here?

GRANDMA: I came to wish my granddaughter luck on her first day of school.

LORELAI: She is my daughter and I decide how we live, not you.

GRANDMA: I’m allowed to pay for it but I can’t actually set foot on the premise. I just want to get the rules straight.

LORELAI: Oh boy.

LORELAI: Oh.

RORY: So this whole plaid skirt thing - my idea?

LORELAI: My day sucked too.

CUT TO GRANDMA’S HOUSE

GRANDPA: Dinner was lovely Emily.

GRANDMA: Mira does make a perfect cassoulet.

LORELAI: Who’s Mira.

GRANDMA: Our cook.

LORELAI: I thought the cook was Heidi.

GRANDMA: Oh no, we let Heidi go months ago. She had a problem closing things. The door, the refrigerator.

GRANDPA: The liquor bottle.

GRANDMA: Then it was Trina, then Sophia.

GRANDPA: Oh I like Sophia.

GRANDMA: You did not.

GRANDPA: I didn’t?

GRANDMA: She was the one who sang.

GRANDPA: That’s right - terrible woman (shudders).

GRANDMA: And after Sophia we had Anton.

GRANDPA: That’s right. Anton was the one that I liked.

LORELAI: I’m sorry, dad. How do you mix up Anton and Sophia?

GRANDPA: What do you mean?

LORELAI: Well, one is a man and one is a woman.

GRANDPA: And your point being?

LORELAI: That one is a man and one is a woman.

GRANDPA: I have a lot to do in a day Lorelai, I don’t have time to keep up with all the multitudes of people your mother employs.

LORELAI: But one is a man and one is a woman. (Rory sighs. Cook brings in dessert.) Oh the dinner was so wonderful, Mira.

COOK: It’s Sarah.

LORELAI: Oh, I’m sorry (cook leaves) Mom, her name is Sarah!

GRANDMA: I thought she said Mira.

LORELAI: Ugh!

RORY: Hey grandma, these plates are really pretty.

GRANDMA: Thank you Rory, they were your great-grandmother’s

GRANDPA: Lorelai the first.

RORY: I thought mom was the first.

GRANDPA: No, no.

GRANDMA: Not in the name.

LORELAI: No, but in so many other things, I was a regular trail blazer. Just finishing your thought mom.

GRANDPA: Well Lorelai the first was my mother. She was an extremely accomplished equestrian, a distinguished patron of the arts and she was also world-famous for her masquerade balls. She was quite a woman my mother.

GRANDMA: Yes she was. Mira come cut the cake please!

LORELAI: Yes and why don’t you bring Sarah out here with you!

GRANDMA: So Lorelai, how are things at that charming little inn of yours?

LORELAI: They’re still charming and little and we’re just crossing our fingers it doesn’t assert itself and become rude and large.

RORY: Mom’s having a huge wedding there this week.

GRANDMA: Really?

LORELAI: Yeah, actually there’s people coming from all over the country.

GRANDMA: Well, isn’t that nice.

LORELAI: Yeah.

GRANDMA: Rory how’s Chilton?

LORELAI: Ok done with me now.

GRANDMA: I’m sorry, was there more to the story?

LORELAI: Uh, Rory has to pick a team sport to play.

RORY: It’s a requirement.

GRANDPA: Physical fitness is as important as intellectual fitness, so says Plato, and so say I.

GRANDMA: What sport are you going to pick?

RORY: I’m not sure. I’m not really the athletic type.

LORELAI: I told her she should go out for the debate team.

RORY: It’s not a sport.

LORELAI: It is the way the Gilmores play.

GRANDMA: So what are your choices.

RORY: God - there’s like a thousand of them. Basketball, lacrosse, swimming, track, golf -

GRANDMA: Golf?

RORY: Yeah.

GRANDMA: Well your grandfather’s a golf player.

LORELAI: Oops.

GRANDMA: He plays ever week at the club. He can teach you to play like a pro.

GRANDPA: Emily.

GRANDMA: Why he could take you there on Sunday. It’s perfect.

GRANDPA: It’s not something you can teach in an afternoon.

LORELAI: That’s ok, Rory can pick something else.

GRANDMA: Why should she pick something else? She needs to learn a sport and Richard can teach her a sport. You can use your mother’s clubs. They’re upstairs gathering dust along with the rest of her potential.

LORELAI: Ok, mom, could I maybe talk to you for a minute?

GRANDMA: We’re having dessert.

LORELAI: I know but I’d like to talk to you fast before the sugar set in and makes me crazy.

GRANDMA: You are the oddest person.

LORELAI: Yeah - too easy. [they leave to go into the other room]

GRANDMA: What is so important that it can’t wait for cake.

LORELAI: Keep moving.

GRANDMA: This is as far as I can go unless you’d like me to bore my way through the wall.

LORELAI: Don’t do this mom.

GRANDMA: Do what?

LORELAI: Force Rory and Dad to go golfing.

GRANDMA: I’m not forcing anybody.

LORELAI: Well you’re manipulating the situation in a way that gives no one a way out - that’s forced, look it up.

GRANDMA: I’m just trying to help your daughter get and education.

LORELAI: Thank you, she’ll find another sport.

GRANDMA: Why should she?

LORELAI: Because she doesn’t want to go and Dad doesn’t want to take her.

GRANDMA: Oh your father doesn’t know what he wants. He’d get his hair cut at the butcher’s if I let him.

LORELAI: Just let it go please.

GRANDMA: Well isn’t this interesting. You’re afraid.

LORELAI: Of what?

GRANDMA: That Rory will enjoy the club and have a good time without you.

LORELAI: That’s crazy.

GRANDMA: I agreed.

LORELAI: I’m not afraid.

GRANDMA: Then let her go.

LORELAI: She won’t enjoy it mom.

GRANDMA: Well why don’t we let Rory decide.

LORELAI: Because Rory is the sweetest kid in the whole world and she won’t tell you that she doesn’t want to go because she’s too afraid of hurting your feelings.

GRANDMA: Oh I’m sure you can give her some coaching to get over that.

LORELAI: I’m not trying to hurt your feelings mom. Believe it or not, this is not about you.

GRANDMA: Of course it’s about me. If Rory goes and has a good time without you, then I win.

LORELAI: Ok, Bob Barker. Listen, Rory knocks herself out all week at Chilton, the weekends are the only time she has to unwind and have fun.

GRANDMA: With you.

LORELAI: I’m there.

GRANDMA: So let me get this straight - there’s no way that Rory could possibly enjoy a weekend day with her grandfather.

LORELAI: Oh, you’re just gonna twist it all around aren’t you?

GRANDMA: And you know your daughter so well that you don’t even have to ask her opinion on this, she’s be miserable and you know it.

LORELAI: I’m so setting myself up here, but yes, she would be miserable.

GRANDMA: That sounds a little controlling to me.

LORELAI: Yeah, I walked right into that.

GRANDMA: Interesting isn’t it, you being the one who’s controlling.

LORELAI: I am not being -

GRANDMA: According to you I was the only one in the family with that particular gift.

LORELAI: Mom I never said that!

GRANDMA: I guess you and I are more alike than you thought, aren’t we?

LORELAI: [raising her hands in surrender] You win.

GRANDMA: Thank you.

CUT TO OUTSIDE GRANDMA’S HOUSE

LORELAI: [sighs] Oh man, did you get blindsided? I’m so sorry!

RORY: That’s ok.

LORELAI: I tried to stop it - I swear.

RORY: I know. Maybe it won’t be that bad.

LORELAI: Maybe it won’t.

RORY: Maybe I’ll like it.

LORELAI: Maybe you will.

RORY: Maybe you could come with me.

LORELAI: Oh, is there a ‘you’re crazy’ team? Cause I think they’d make you captain.

RORY: Please?

LORELAI: Rory, I love you. I would take a bullet for you, but I would rather stick something sharp in my ear than go to the club with you.

RORY: Fine.

LORELAI: I’d rather slide down a banister of razors and land in a pool of alcohol than go to the club with you.

RORY: I got it.

LORELAI: Don’t stop me I’m on a roll. I’d rather eat my own hand than go to the club with you. Ooh, I’d rather get my face surgically altered to look like that lunatic witch lady with the lion head than go to the club with you.

RORY: Would you like me to drive so you can continue your diatribe

LORELAI: Would you? Thanks. I’d rather cut off my head and use it as a punch bowl than go to the club with you.

CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN

[Lorelai walking with twin brides and mom.]

LORELAI: You’ll walk down here over the bridge with the swans floating by and the music playing.

JACKIE: What are they doing with those purple flowers?

LORELAI: Just decorating the bridge.

JACKIE: I didn’t want purple flowers - I wanted pink.

JESSICA: And I wanted blue.

LORELAI: So I thought violet would be a nice compromise.

JACKIE: But we paid for pink flowers.

JESSICA: And blue flowers.

MRS. SHALES: You did not pay for anything. I told her to decorate with violet flowers and while it’s very nice of her to try to take the heat for me, it’s certainly not necessary. If you don’t like it, buy your own flowers. [both girls are silent] Yes. I thought so. Now go away, my advil is wearing off. [girls leave] Their father spoiled them.

LORELAI: Oh they’re just excited.

MRS. SHALES: They’re spoiled. And they won’t move away. [walking back to the inn] Now disaster list, what if it rain?

LORELAI: We’ll put up tents.

MRS. SHALES: What if it’s too windy?

LORELAI: Well then we’ll secure everything and put extra hairspray in everybody’s hair.

MRS. SHALES: Too hot?

LORELAI: We’ll use umbrellas and fans that won’t cause any damage because of the things that have been secured and the hair that has been sprayed.

MRS. SHALES: So I have nothing to worry about?

LORELAI: Nope.

MRS. SHALES: Oh there must be something.

LORELAI: Listen, I have everything under control. Why don’t you go up to your room and have a fabulous bubble bath and I’ll send up some wine and a masseuse who bears a remarkable resemblance to Antonio Banderas.

MRS. SHALES: How remarkable?

LORELAI: Get ready to applaud.

MRS. SHALES: This is my favorite place in the whole world.

[Pan to inside Inn. Michel handing out gift baskets.]

LORELAI: [to employee] Could you send Maury up to room 12 in about 20 minutes? Thanks. [to Michel] So, any problems?

MICHEL: With the wedding or my life?

LORELAI: One guess, and I’ll give you a hint - it’s not your life!

MICHEL: Do you stage these events to torture me?

LORELAI: Yes.

MICHEL: Job well done.

LORELAI: Ok, let’s start again. Any problems?

MICHEL: Guests are checked in, baskets are given out, and 200,000 tons of Jordan almonds have been delivered.

LORELAI: Ok good. Did Rory call?

MICHEL: No.

LORELAI: Hmm. She’s golfing all day with my father and I’m half expecting this big ‘save me’ call to come in and - you don’t care at all do you?

MICHEL: To me you are the teacher in a Charlie Brown cartoon.

LORELAI: Ok, forget it. So have the grooms arrived yet? Their plane was supposed to get in at 7:30, I’m surprised they’re not here by now.

MICHEL: Well maybe they made a run for it.

LORELAI: Ooh, somebody got stood up at the prom.

MICHEL: [looks up] Oh…dear.

LORELAI: What? [looks up and see twins enter the inn] Wow.

MICHEL: Are those -

LORELAI: No, it would be…

[Twin brides run up to twin grooms]

LORELAI: Weird.

MICHEL: You kept this from me on purpose.

LORELAI: It’s like a really snooty Doublemint commercial.

MICHEL: Just let me know when the midgets and clowns arrives.[turns and leaves]

LORELAI: Oh no - no, no. You have to get them all settled in.

MICHEL: I’m not talking to them.

LORELAI: Yes you are.

MICHEL: Well I’m not talking to them nicely.

CUT TO GRANDMA’S HOUSE

GRANDPA: It’s after 8:00, she should be here already.

GRANDMA: She’ll be here.

GRANDPA: You’re supposed to tee off at your designated time.

GRANDMA: You pay good money to that place, you’ll tee off when you tee off. Is that what you’re wearing?

GRANDPA: Yes.

GRANDMA: Hmm.

GRANDPA: What’s wrong with what I’m wearing?

GRANDMA: Nothing, it’s fine.

GRANDPA: This whole thing is absurd!

GRANDMA: She’s your granddaughter.

GRANDPA: She’s a 16 year old who would rather be at the mall.

GRANDMA: Make sure you show her all around the club - especially the rose garden.

GRANDPA: I am not a guide.

GRANDMA: And make sure you take her to lunch, and have her get dessert.

GRANDPA: No one said anything about lunch.

GRANDMA: I hope Lorelai’s clubs are still in good shape.

GRANDPA: Emily, you are not listening to me. I will teach her to golf, as promised by you, but lunch is out of the question.

GRANDMA: You have to eat.

GRANDPA: Yes well -

GRANDMA: So you’ll eat together. Do you have sunscreen?

GRANDPA: Emily.

[Doorbell rings]

GRANDMA: Oh she’s here.

GRANDPA: Oh 8:30. We must remember to buy her a watch.

GRANDMA: Richard, so help me God, you will be sweet to this girl and make this a memorable day for her. This is the first time we’ve gotten to show off our granddaughter at the club and it means a great deal for my happiness - and yours - that this day go well. Are we clear? [Grandpa nods. Opens door] Rory! Hello!

RORY: Sorry I’m late.

GRANDMA: Nonsense, you’re right on time.

RORY: Hi Grandpa.

GRANDPA: Rory, nice to see you.

GRANDMA: This is a perfect day for golfing isn’t it Richard?

GRANDPA: It’s cooler at 8:00

RORY: Am I dressed ok? I didn’t have any of those short pant things.

GRANDMA: Well actually there is something missing. Oh wait a minute. [puts a colorful beret on her] There you go, now you look just like Tiger Woods.

RORY: Wow, that’s some hat.

GRANDMA: Ok, off you go you two. Have a wonderful time.

RORY: We will.

GRANDPA: You bet. [Grandpa and Grandma stare at each other for a moment, then he leaves]

CUT TO CLUB

RORY: Is it hard to become a member here?

GRANDPA: Well, everyone has to go through a thorough screening process.

RORY: Kind of like the FBI?

GRANDPA: Oh, we’re much more thorough than that.

RORY: Wow.

GRANDPA: Yes. Do you know the merger of Forscape and DSS happened right here on this lawn?

RORY: Really?

GRANDPA: Mm. International finance will never be the same and all because of a lost golfing bet.

RORY: That’s crazy.

GRANDPA: Well that’s high finance. Well, here we are. Now what do you know about golf?

RORY: That it’s a good walk spoiled.

GRANDPA: Well, your driver is your most powerful club in your bag. And as such it can be your most valuable asset or your greatest liability. To wield it properly, requires a precise combination of confidence and humility.

RORY: Confidence and humility - got it.

GRANDPA: There you are [handing her the club] Oh that’s a pretty good natural grip. Now line the toe of your left foot up with the ball. That’s right. Now drop this shoulder a bit. Now, keeping your left arm firm, draw the club back and swing it cleanly through that ball. [Rory swings and hits the grass in front of the ball]

RORY: I’m betting that was wrong.

GRANDPA: There are no rights or wrongs to the learning process.[ fills divot] Try that again. [She swings and hits that divot]

RORY: I’m betting that was wrong.

CUT TO INN KITCHEN

[Jackson comes in and puts a box down on the counter]

SOOKIE: These are blueberries. I think I ordered strawberries.

JACKSON: I know.

SOOKIE: Yeah - no I did. I wrote it down. I got a copy.

JACKSON: Sookie listen -

SOOKIE: [picks up list] Yeah. Mushrooms, melon, endive, peaches, kiwi -

JACKSON: Excuse me crazy lady.

SOOKIE: Ooh I should make some kiwi ice cream. That would be good sometime -

JACKSON: Sookie!

SOOKIE: What?

JACKSON: Listen, I know you ordered strawberries, but they weren’t any good. So instead of selling you substandard strawberries, I brought you blueberries.

SOOKIE: Huh. Well I’ve gotta make strawberry shortcake for 200 people, so I think I’m gonna need the strawberries.

JACKSON: Use the blueberries.

SOOKIE: To make what?

JACKSON: Blueberries shortcake.

SOOKIE: There’s no such thing.

JACKSON: Hey the world was flat until someone took a boat trip.

SOOKIE: Can I see these strawberries?

JACKSON: No.

SOOKIE: Just one?

JACKSON: No.

SOOKIE: How about a polaroid?

JACKSON: No.

LORELAI:[entering kitchen] Coffee, coffee, coffee. Ooh Sookie, can I take some of this cake home to Rory? She’s gonna need some special treat tonight. She’s spending the entire day with my father golfing at the club.

SOOKIE: No.

JACKSON: Take the blueberries!

SOOKIE: No!

LORELAI: The whole thing was masterminded by my mother, of course. One minute we’re having an excruciating family dinner, the next minute she’s manipulated my kid into spending her Sunday with my father at the country club. Oh, I can’t talk about it anymore, it’s making me too upset. Tell me something happy.

SOOKIE: [almost in tears] I can’t make the strawberry shortcake.

LORELAI: Wow, you suck at this game.

MICHEL: [entering kitchen] The battle for soup versus salad is raging in the other room. Come quick and settle it please as I am running out of french curse words that they won’t understand. [Lorelai pouts and leaves]

[Pan to Lobby]

JESSICA: Soup.

JACKIE: Salad.

JESSICA: You always have salad before a traditional dinner.

JACKIE: Why are you making such a scene Jessica.

[Mom comes rushing up to Lorelai]

MRS. SHALES: It’s been 45 minutes of soup or salad - soup or salad. I can’t do it anymore. Get me a cab, I’m going to go far away now and never come back.

LORELAI: Well how about if the guest get a choice of soup or salad.

MRS. SHALES: That might work [goes back to girls who are still arguing as Sookie joins Lorelai and Michel]

LORELAI: Choice of soup or salad.

SOOKIE: Got it.

LORELAI: It’s so weird [as grooms join brides]

SOOKIE: Which one is which?

LORELAI: I don’t know. I think the one on the right is Matt.

MICHEL: No the one on the left is Matt, the one on the right is Mark.

LORELAI: That’s very impressive.

MICHEL: Yes well I’m very good at observing people. You know learning their tics and traits, the sound of their voices. It’s a gift.

SOOKIE: That one has a post-it on it’s back.

MICHEL: Oh well then that’s Mark and the one on the right is Matt.

LORELAI: You will go take that off of him.

MICHEL: I will not. We can’t all just call everyone ‘sweetie’ and get away with it.

SOOKIE: Now go with me here, but let’s say Mark walks into a hotel room and sees his wife naked but it’s not his wife, it’s his naked sister-in-law and he has sex with her, would that be cheating.

MICHEL: My head hurts.

LORELAI: [laughing] I think no.

SOOKIE: Really? Lucky.

MICHEL: If you ask me this union belongs on a public access station. It’s against the laws of nature and just this short of completely obscene.

LORELAI: Well you won’t be giving the wedding toast. [goes to see the mother] How did everything work out?

MRS. SHALES: Do you have children?

LORELAI: A daughter.

MRS. SHALES: Do you hate her?

LORELAI: No.

MRS. SHALES: Not ever?

LORELAI: Uh, well I wasn’t wildly fond of her during labour.

MRS. SHALES: That was the high point for me.

CUT TO CLUB

RORY: I can’t believe I hit the ball.

GRANDPA: Well it’s quite impressive.

RORY: It landed in the water.

GRANDPA: Yes but the splash was quite impressive.

RORY: This place is so beautiful. I could see just coming here to think or read, though it probably defeats the purpose of the holes with the flags in them.

GRANDPA: There is something rather serene about walking around here.

RORY: Do you come here every week?

GRANDPA: No, when I can. I’m often working on weekends.

RORY: Bummer.

GRANDPA: Isn’t it?

[cart passes]

MAN: Bye Richard [Grandpa waves]

RORY: Can I ask you a question?

GRANDPA: Go ahead.

RORY: What do you do?

GRANDPA: I’m Executive Vice President of the Gehrman-Driscoll Insurance Corporation.

RORY: Wow.

GRANDPA: Yes.

RORY: And as Executive Vice President, what do you do?

GRANDPA: Well it’s a very big company - one of the largest in the US as a matter a fact. I have a myriad of duties which would bore you greatly to hear about.

RORY: Oh, ok.

GRANDPA: I oversee our international division.

RORY: That sounds important.

GRANDPA: Well it rates a parking spot.

RORY: Do you get to travel a lot?

GRANDPA: Quite a bit.

RORY: Lucky.

GRANDPA: I suspect you have a yen for travel.

RORY: I’m up to my ears in yens.

GRANDPA: Any particular place you’d like to go?

RORY: Hundreds of places - Paris, Rome, London, Prague, Istanbul, Fez - have you ever been to Fez?

GRANDPA: Can’t say that I have.

RORY: I want to go to Fez.

GRANDPA: I think traveling for a young girl is a very important thing. Your mother never got a chance to travel much.

RORY: I know, she talks about that all the time.

GRANDPA: She does?

RORY: We’ve got a deal. When I graduate from high school, we’re gonna go backpacking through Europe together. You know, do the whole hostel thing. I just hope it really happens.

GRANDPA: Well we’ll just have to make sure it does.

[cart comes up to them]

GLORIA: Richard!

GRANDPA: Gloria, you look wonderful.

GLORIA: Aren’t you sweet? Is Emily here?

GRANDPA: No, I’m taking my granddaughter for a round of golf.

GLORIA: Well we must get together.

GRANDPA: Absolutely. [cart leaves. To Rory] Most odious woman alive. [Pan to front of clubhouse]

GRANDPA: Uh, now. We’ll meet back here in 40 minutes?

RORY: Ok.

GRANDPA: And then if you’d like we can get some lunch.

RORY: That’s be great.

GRANDPA: Fine.

RORY: Cool.

GRANDPA: Yes.

[Pan to men’s steam room]

MAN #1: And I’m telling him, I’ve been coming here for 20 years my young friend and for 20 years that cart, number 43, has been my golf cart.

MAN#2: he should have known that.

MAN #1: Oh everybody knows it.

MAN #3: Did he give you the cart?

MAN #1: Damn right he gave me that cart.

MAN #2: You should’ve never had to ask because he should have known.

GRANDMA: Hello gentlemen.

MAN #1: Richard, good to see you.

GRANDPA: Heard about your golf cart - too bad.

MAN #1: Yeah, well I’m still angry about it.

GRANDPA: Well yes.

MAN #3: Richard, who was that young lady I saw you on the golf course with?

GRANDPA: That is my granddaughter.

MAN #2: Really? She’s lovely.

MAN #1: Lorelai’s girl.

GRANDPA: Mm-hmm.

MAN #3: You’re lucky. My granddaughter looks like she just fell off a potato truck. [Grandpa chuckles]

MAN #2: My granddaughter would never be caught in here. It might get in the way of her time spent at the tattoo parlour or getting something pierced or doing whatever she does while she runs wild through the streets like a rabid dog.

MAN #1: Cut her off! That’ll get her attention!

MAN #3: I can help you with the litigation.

MAN #1: Yeah.

GRANDPA: Actually Rory just started Chilton.

MAN #3: Really?

MAN #1: Damn fine school.

GRANDPA: She said she wanted to learn golf. I think she’s taken to it quite well.

MAN #1: Well, just as long as she’s not taken with a certain golf cart.

MAN #2: I’m writing a letter to the board.

MAN #1: I wish you would.

[The three men continue to discuss]

[Pan the women’s steam room. Rory listening to two women talk]

WOMAN #1: And you know she took the house.

WOMAN #2: And she deserved it - putting up with that tramp for all those years.

WOMAN #1: Oh, last year christmas. He bought them both the same bracelet.

WOMAN #2: She should’ve just shot him like his first wife did.

WOMAN #1: Oh I love Janie - is she out yet?

[Gloria enters]

GLORIA: Nannette, Peg.

WOMAN #1: Gloria hi. Good game?

GLORIA: Not bad, you?

WOMAN #1: Oh, I just came for the steam. We must get together and play some time soon.

GLORIA: Next week?

WOMAN #1: I’ll call you. [Gloria moves to the other side of the steam room. Woman #1 whispers] The most odious woman alive.

CUT TO OUTSIDE INN

LORELAI: Ok, I need more tulle here. I need the feeling of a major tutu ok? Ooh, uh, hey Gary? Gary? The ribbons go on the chairs ok, not the trees. Oh, great. Hey.

SWAN GUY: Where do you want the swans?

LORELAI: Um, well do you know where the pond is?

SWAN GUY: Nope.

LORELAI: Ok, you know that little road you came up?

SWAN GUY: Nope.

LORELAI: Ok, do you know how to say ‘big help’ in Chinese?

SWAN GUY: Nope.

LORELAI: Michel! [to guy] This is 20 swans?

SWAN GUY: Sure why not.

MICHEL: You screeched?

LORELAI: Yeah, I need you to show this guy where to put the swans.

MICHEL: Absolutely not.

LORELAI: Well I can’t leave ok? I have a major tulle festival going on out here.

MICHEL: I will never go near those filthy birds.

LORELAI: Why?

MICHEL: I hate swans.

LORELAI: These particular swans?

MICHEL: No, all swans. I was attacked by a band of swans in the Luxembourg gardens when I was a boy. No one forgets that.

LORELAI: Oh no - not being attacked by a band of swans. Was it an all-boy band - kind of a scary feathery N’SYNC kind of fiasco?

MICHEL: This is not funny.

LORELAI: No. I’m sorry it’s not. It’s not funny at all. [swan honks and Michel jumps] Oh my God! Now come on, you have to admit that’s a little funny.

DRELLA: Hey Pepe le Pew, you wanna give me a hand here?

MICHEL: No.

LORELAI: Listen, it’s Drella or the swans.

MICHEL: So, either one beast of terror or another?

DRELLA: What the hell is he babbling about?

MICHEL: Don’t.

LORELAI: He’s afraid of the swan.

MICHEL: Thank you.

DRELLA: Of course he is, he’s French.

LORELAI: Mm.

MICHEL: Ok, I’ll take you to the pond.

LORELAI: Thank you.

MICHEL: But stay far away from me [starts down the path far in front of the swans and continuously looking behind him at the swans]

DRELLA: Can’t stand the talk, love to watch the walk.

CUT TO CLUB

RORY: She caught him in the pool house with the tennis pro, not the riding instructor.

GRANDPA: I had no idea.

RORY: That committee of yours is not looking at people as much as you think.

GRANDPA: Huh, why would they? From what you’ve told me, they’re all involved in one nefarious activity after another.

RORY: It’s a conspiracy.

GRANDPA: It’s ‘Peyton Place’. Is there more?

RORY: Can you handle it?

GRANDPA: Oh, I’ll steel myself.

RORY: Ok. Mr. Neville likes all things frilly.

GRANDPA: Good God. He’s my broker.

RORY: Well I don’t think one will affect the other.

MAN #1: Mind if we barge in?

GRANDPA: Well, look who’s here. Ah, Rory, this is Julian Johnson and Edward James.

MAN #2: Call me Ed.

MAN #1: Yeah you can call me Ed too.

RORY: It’s nice to meet you.

GRANDPA: Would you care to join us?

MAN #2: If Rory doesn’t mind us intruding on her time with her grandfather.

RORY: No, that’s fine.

MAN #1: Ah good. [both sitting] So we hear your attending Chilton.

RORY: I just started.

MAN #1:That’s a hard school.

RORY: Yes sir.

GRANDPA: Rory is an excellent student.

MAN #1: Really.

GRANDPA: 4.0 grade point average.

MAN #1: Wow, that’s got me beat! [Man #1 and Man #2 laugh]

GRANDPA: She’s going to Fez someday.

MAN #1: Fez? What the hell is in Fez?

GRANDPA: That’s for her to find out. [Rory and Grandpa exchange looks]

CUT TO LUKE’S

[Rory sitting playing with the beret]

LUKE: Interesting hat. [puts on hat]

RORY: I went golfing with my grandfather today.

LUKE: Did you know that golf courses are an environmental blight because of the chemicals they use to keep the grass green?

RORY: Actually I did. [Luke looks at her] Bad joke, sorry.

[Lorelai enters]

LORELAI: Oh…my God - this day - the swans, the tulle, my head. Luke, I need the largest cheeseburger in the world - let’s break a record mister. So, the wedding is a nightmare. We got these 10 boxes of creepy larvae that are supposed to swarm into beautiful butterflies on the wedding day. They swarmed a little early. What’s with the hat?

RORY: Grandma gave it to me.

LORELAI: Oh, now that’s just mean.

RORY: It’s not that bad.

LORELAI: Do you want a mirror?

RORY: I’m taking the hat off.

LORELAI: So, Rory’s golfing adventure - tell me.

RORY: It was fine.

LORELAI: Oh honey, I brought you some of Sookie’s chocolate cake to make you feel better.

RORY: It really wasn’t that bad.

LORELAI: You are the sweetest kid in the entire world. Where on earth did you get that from? Luke, am I mistaken or did the sign on the door say open? So where were we?

RORY: Me golfing.

LORELAI: Right. Go.

RORY: Ok, well, um, by the end of the day, I could even hit the ball.

LORELAI: Oh.

RORY: Sometimes it wasn’t my ball but the intentions were good.

LORELAI: Well good intentions and no physical exertion is what the game of golf was built on. So, um, did you order?

RORY: I’m not hungry. I had a big lunch at the club.

LUKE: With all the other devastators of our land.

RORY: Luke I’m really sorry, I didn’t know.

LUKE: You had a big lunch at the club?

RORY: Yup, it was quite good.

LORELAI: Quite? What’s with the ‘quite’?

RORY: What do you mean?

LORELAI: You don’t ever say quite.

RORY: I say quite plenty of times.

LORELAI: Whatever. So besides the quite good lunch you had, what else happened.

RORY: Nothing, we played, I met his friends, I took a steam.

LORELAI: You took a steam?

RORY: Yeah. I sweated out all my toxins and I stole a towel.

LORELAI: Wow. Sounds like you really had a good time.

RORY: I did.

LORELAI: Really?

RORY: Really.

LORELAI: Really?

RORY: Really.

LORELAI: Really?

RORY: Ok - new word now.

LORELAI: Sorry, I just - I’m just surprised. I thought you’d be bored.

RORY: I was kinda surprised too. I don’t know. It was pretty there and Grandpa and I talked a lot.

LORELAI: You talked? Really?

RORY: You’re doing it again.

LORELAI: Sorry. You talked?

RORY: We talked about Fez.

LORELAI: And he thought it was a hat.

RORY: I told him about our backpacking trip. He thought it was a great idea.

LORELAI: Wow. So you really had fun.

RORY: Yeah.

LORELAI: That’s great. That’s really, really, great. [Luke puts a burger in front of Lorelai who doesn’t touch it]

LUKE: I thought you were starving.

LORELAI: Things change, move on.

RORY: Does this hat really look bad on me

LORELAI: [pause] No, I think it kinda looks cute.

CUT TO INN

MISS PATTY: It’s you wedding day. Feel each other. Use the thumping of your heart as your metronome, let passion be your choreographer. Be as light on your toes as you are in you hearts. Oh no, no, no, darling, let me show you how it’s done [pulls away bride and pulls groom to her]

GROOM: Again?

MISS PATTY: You know, in some countries if you dance this close you’re cheating on your wife.

GROOM: You’re next.

GROOM #2: Take your time.

[Pan to inside Inn]

LORELAI: Hey. Oh my God you have good handwriting.

RORY: Thank you.

LORELAI: You did not get that from me. Your fabulous flair you got from me.

RORY: I also got my deviated septum from you.

LORELAI: Hey, focus on the flair.

MICHEL: It’s for you. He says he’s your father, thought why he’d volunteer that freely I don’t know.

LORELAI: My father?

MICHEL: Yes.

LORELAI: Are you sure?

MICHEL: Please just take the phone [she does] Thank you.

LORELAI: Dad? Yeah it’s Lorelai, who else calls you dad? [pause] Yeah she’s right here, hold on.[To Rory] It’s for you.

RORY: Thanks. Hello? Hey Grandpa. That’s great. [gets up and goes and sits on a couch while Lorelai watches]

[Pan to Drella and Mrs. Shales walking through lobby]

MRS. SHALES: Now Jackie wasn’t Samuel Barber, John Cage and Philip Glass. And Jessica wants Shania Twain’s ‘I feel like a woman’.

DRELLA: I’m not a jukebox.

MRS. SHALES: Oh please.

DRELLA: Hey do you think I started playing the harp because I thought it would make me cool - you know, it would finally get me in with the in-crowd? Maybe I’d make for some great happy-hour conversation. No, alright - the music drives me lady. I will play what I feel and you will love it.

MRS. SHALES: I’ll give you an extra $100.

DRELLA: You just got yourself a jukebox.

[Pan to Rory on the couch, with Lorelai watching.]

RORY: Yeah, yeah I’d love to see it. [pause] No, if you want to.[pause] Sure that sounds good. Yeah.

CUT TO GILMORE PORCH

[Rory is looking at herself in a mirror]

LORELAI: Should I leave you two alone?

RORY: I think I wanna change my hair.

LORELAI: Really? I think it looks quite good.

RORY: You’re funny. Do you want something to drink? [going into the kitchen]

LORELAI: Oh yeah - water. So you talked to Grandpa today?!

RORY: What?! [from kitchen]

LORELAI: Grandpa - he called?!

RORY: Yep!

LORELAI: Anything wrong?!

RORY: [coming back out]No he just found this book we were talking about.

LORELAI: Oh, and he just called to tell you?

RORY: Yeah why?

LORELAI: Nothing. It’s just weird. He just doesn’t call the inn that much, or ever actually.

RORY: Well he knew that I was looking for it so…

LORELAI: Oh sure. What book was it?

RORY: Mencken’s ‘Chrestomathy’.

LORELAI: Oh that one.

RORY: Yeah.

BABETTE: [coming up the stairs] Hey! Cinnamon’s stuck under our front porch again. Can I borrow some vegetable oil and a shoe horn?

RORY: I’ll get it. [gets up and goes into the kitchen]

BABETTE: I’m calling him and calling him and I go around the porch and this big orange tush is just staring me in the face.

LORELAI: I hate when that happens.

BABETTE: Yeah. He must have been meowing for an hour, but Morey was playing some Thelonious on the steinway and when Morey plays, I go into this trance where all I can see is blue and moon and stars.

[Hear a loud meow]

MOREY: He’s out Babs!

BABETTE: Oh never mind sugar. [to Morey] Play me home baby!

LORELAI: Bye.

BABETTE: Oh God! It’s killing me!

RORY: [comes back with oil] Babette didn’t take her oil.

LORELAI: Oh keep it, christmas is early this year. So you know what I was thinking?

RORY: That Madonna and Sean Penn should get re-married?

LORELAI: Besides that. I was thinking that your golfing expedition should totally count as a dinner.

RORY: What do you mean?

LORELAI: I mean I think I can get us out of dinner at the grandparents on

Friday. Maybe we can grab a movie.

RORY: Oh, well that’s ok.

LORELAI: It’s not big deal, really.

RORY: No, it’s just gonna get Grandma all freaked out.

LORELAI: Yeah, but I can handle those freak outs. I’ve done that.

RORY: You know, I have to get the book from Grandpa anyway. Let’s just go.

LORELAI: Oh alright. If you really want to.

RORY: I do.

LORELAI: Ok. Fine. Is that my sweater?

RORY: What?

LORELAI: You’re wearing my sweater.

RORY: So?

LORELAI: No, it’s ok. It’s just I thought I asked you to at least ask you know, before you borrow my stuff.

RORY: I’m sorry.

LORELAI: It’s ok. It’s just - it’s not too much for a simple ‘Can I borrow it mom’ is it?

RORY: No, it’s not. Jeez, lighten up.

LORELAI: It’s my favorite sweater too.

RORY: Since when?

LORELAI: Since always.

RORY: This is not your favorite sweater.

LORELAI: Yes it is and now it’s gonna be all stretched out just like everything else you borrow.

RORY: What are you talking about?

LORELAI: I’m talking about that you take my sweaters and you wear them and you stretch them out.

RORY: I couldn’t possibly stretch them out! Your boobs are way bigger than mine!

LORELAI: That is not true.

RORY: Yes it is.

LORELAI: Your boobs are totally bigger than mine!

RORY: You’re crazy!

LORELAI: Do you want to measure?

RORY: What?

LORELAI: I’m serious. Why don’t you go get the measuring tape. Right now.

RORY: I am not going to measure my boobs.

LORELAI: Because you know that you’re totally bigger.

RORY: I’m going inside.

LORELAI: Fine. Don’t measure. We’ll just compare bras.

RORY: Stop it!

LORELAI: I’ll stop it when you quit stealing my stuff!

RORY: You’re cracked![goes inside]

LORELAI: You’re…bigger!

CUT TO STREET

[Lorelai and Sookie walking]

LORELAI: ‘You’re boobs are bigger than mine?’ God, I’m a mental case.

SOOKIE: So apologize.

LORELAI: No, I was too mad and stupid to apologize last night and then she was gone before I got up this morning. What is wrong with me?

SOOKIE: You’re very possessive of your sweaters.

LORELAI: Sookie.

SOOKIE: No, I understand. I’m just saying if somebody breathes too hard on my paring knife, I’m like a crazy spider monkey.

LORELAI: It’s not about the sweater. It’s about the golfing thing. And the liking it thing. She had fun Sookie, just like my mother said she would.

SOOKIE: Yeah, that’s gotta hurt.

LORELAI: She should have fun. I mean I want her to have a good relationship with her grandparents. Just because I don’t doesn’t mean she shouldn’t right?

SOOKIE: Right.

LORELAI: Right. So why was I trying to get her out of Friday night dinner? I mean what am I trying to do, undermine their relationship?

SOOKIE: No you weren’t.

LORELAI: Yes I was.

SOOKIE: Yes you were.

LORELAI: Yes, I’m four years old.

SOOKIE: You’re jealous.

LORELAI: Oh I’m not jealous.

SOOKIE: Yeah you are. You’re jealous because they like Rory better than you.

LORELAI: Oh thank you for the hug.

SOOKIE: See I’m bad at advice talks. Can we talk about soup? Because I’m good with soup.

LORELAI: Oh, I’m sorry. You’re good. I’m just all mixed up. I left that life you know - the club, my parents - I ran from it as soon as I could. It just - it never occurred to me that she might want it. It occurred to my mother though. God I hate that she was right.

SOOKIE: You don’t know that sh - Ooh, ooh my God!

[Runs across the street causing a guy on a bicycle go over his handle bars] GUY: Watch it!

LORELAI: Oh, ooh. Ooh! Aah! Are you ok? Ok.[runs across the street to catch up to Sookie]

SOOKIE: [to strawberries] Look at you! You’re beautiful!

LORELAI: I have to be more adult about this. I mean, if the country club life is what she wants, more power to her right? You know, little white gloves and coming-out parties, that makes some girls happy right?

SOOKIE: Sure, yeah - if they’re on Prozac, absolutely.

LORELAI: I just never thought that I raised that kind of kid you know. Not that there’s anything wrong with that kind of kid - I just - I didn’t think that was Rory. Maybe it’s not, I don’t know. Am I obsessing? [Sookie doesn’t answer] Sookie? Hello? Do I have to put on my strawberry costume to get your full attention?

SOOKIE: No, I’m sorry. You have a strawberry costume.

[Jackson walks by and see Sookie]

JACKSON: Unbelievable!

SOOKIE: Jackson.

JACKSON: So this is what we’ve come to - you sneaking around behind my back buying somebody else’s strawberries?

SOOKIE: I was desperate.

JACKSON: You disgust me.

SOOKIE: I needed the strawberries.

JACKSON: Well now you have’em! I hope you’re happy together.

SOOKIE: Jackson, wait!

JACKSON: No!

[Jackson walks away, Sookie follows]

SOOKIE: Come on Jackson!

JACKSON: No!

SOOKIE: Jackson we can talk about this!

JACKSON: No!

SOOKIE: Jackson get back here! [Jackson running down the street, Sookie following him yelling at him to stop]

CUT TO WEDDING AT THE INN

[People dancing. Miss Patty dancing as well.]

MRS. SHALES: Oh, pardon me [seeing Lorelai] There you are! We did it.

LORELAI: We sure did.

MRS. SHALES: God, I feel wonderful.

LORELAI: I’m so glad it turned out the way you wanted it to.

MRS. SHALES: Oh, you have no idea. They just told me they’re going to share a condo in Tuscan, Arizona. That’s hundred of miles away!

LORELAI: Congratulations.

MRS. SHALES: Oh thank you. [music plays] Sister Sledge, excuse me! [leaves to go dance]

LORELAI: [goes and sits with Rory who’s manning the guest book] Hey stranger.

RORY: Hey.

LORELAI: Good turn out.

RORY: Yep.

LORELAI: Do you want something to drink?

RORY: Are you trying to make up?

LORELAI: No, I’m trying to hydrate you.

RORY: I’m fine, thanks.

LORELAI: I’m sorry.

RORY: It’s ok.

LORELAI: A crazy evil spirit obsessed with bra size took over my body.

RORY: It happens.

LORELAI: She’s gone now.

RORY: Good to know.

LORELAI: You know, I’m glad you’re bonding with your grandparents.

RORY: No you’re not.

LORELAI: Yes I am. It’s just weird for me, is all. I just - I can’t relate to it.

RORY: You could if you tried.

LORELAI: No we’re too - too much has happened. I’m glad you are anyway

RORY: Ok.

LORELAI: I didn’t mean to cut you off from them so completely you know. It just happened. Not having them in my life just felt so right, I just never thought - I’m sorry.

[They hear a mother lecturing a girl]

MOTHER: I did not pay $500 for this dress so you could run around and mess it up. Now you sit and be still. Cross your legs, you’re a lady.

LORELAI: God, I must have had a million dresses like that when I was a kid.

RORY: It doesn’t really scream you.

LORELAI: No, I did all the screaming.

RORY: Thank you for not putting me in a dress like that.

LORELAI: You’re welcome. Of course wearing those dresses - not all bad. RORY: No?

LORELAI: Oh no. They really fly up when you twirl around.

RORY: Huh.

LORELAI: And if you’re wearing that ruffled underwear - big crowd pleaser.

RORY: If it makes you feel better, I think I got a fungus from the steam room.

LORELAI: It does, thank you.

CUT TO GRANDMA’S HOUSE

GRANDMA: Oh good you’re here.

LORELAI: Hey.

RORY: Hi Grandma.

GRANDMA: My goodness, what’s that?

LORELAI: We brought dessert.

GRANDMA: Really? How thoughtful. What is it?

LORELAI: Blueberry shortcake.

GRANDMA: I’ve never heard of blueberry shortcake before.

LORELAI: Yeah, it’s a Stars Hollow specialty.

GRANDMA: Why is it already cut?

LORELAI: It’s left over…from the wedding…at the inn.

GRANDMA: Yes I know where the wedding was.

LORELAI: Oh sorry, you were just doing that staring thing.

GRANDMA: You brought us used dessert?

LORELAI: It’s not used. It’s leftover.

GRANDMA: How nice. I’ll just put it in the kitchen next to my half empty

box of Cheer. [taking it to the kitchen.]

LORELAI: [whispers to Rory] She’s in a good mood tonight.

GRANDMA: Can I get you a drink?

LORELAI: White wine would be great.

RORY: Coke.

GRANDMA: So Lorelai, did Rory tell you all about the wonderful time she had at the club?

LORELAI: She sure did.

GRANDMA: Your father was simply flying all week. She really charmed him.

LORELAI: Aw, well if anyone could it would be her

GRANDMA: I mean in this age of MTV and 100 tv channels, who would’ve imagined that a young girl could still get a thrill spending a simple afternoon with her grandfather?

LORELAI: That wine would be real good right now mom.

GRANDMA: I think we should consider getting her a membership at the club don’t you?

LORELAI: If she wants - sure.

GRANDMA: I mean to have a place to go to socialize - that’s very important to a young girl.

LORELAI: Well now especially that the crack den has closed down on the corner, all her really good friends are gone. [Grandma looks at her] What do you think mom, should I pursue the career in comedy?

GRANDMA: It’s just very interesting the way things turned out isn’t it?

GRANDPA: [entering room] Oh you’re here. Lorelai.

LORELAI: Dad.

GRANDPA: Rory, I have a surprise. Not only did I find that copy of Mencken’s ‘Chrestomathy’ that we discussed, I also found a first edition of his memoirs as well.

RORY: You’re kidding.

GRANDPA: It’s in my office if you’d like to see them.

RORY: Oh my God, I totally would.

GRANDMA: I’d like to take a look at those myself [hands Lorelai her wine and follows leaving Lorelai alone. Lorelai sighs]

The End
